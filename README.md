# MSDS-422-Home-Equity-Assignment
In this course, the primary focus was using Machine Learning models and libraries to analyze a dateset containing Home Equity loans. The dataset contains two target variables: one indicating whether or not a loan defaulted, and the other indicating the loss amount if the loan went bad. Each assignment built on top of the previous. Assignments 1 and 2 were focused on data preparation and building the three different models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) we'd be analyzing respectively. In Assignment 3, I performed both linear and logistic regressions on Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models of the dataset to see which model produces the most accurate results. Logistic regression was used to determine the probability of a loan default, while linear regression was performed to calculate the losses assuming a loan defaults. In Assignment 4, I used Tensorflow to build on top of the previous assignment. Using Tensorflow, I again built a model that would be predictive of both loan defaults and the amount of money lost in such a case.
